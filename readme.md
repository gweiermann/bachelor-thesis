# About
This is for my bachelor thesis. I am trying to achieve a code challenge website like leet code. It should be structured in chapters like my lectures would be.
I want my core feature to be that running the code will also visualize, what your own code does, using animations.

# Current Goal
As the visualization is my core feature, I'm trying to start with creating a docker image that collects runtime information about the user's program using gdb.  
See [command.sh](command.sh) to run it.
